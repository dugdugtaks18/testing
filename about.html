        <h2><b>Bibolocious Restaurant</b></h2>
        <p>
"Bibolicious", that was the name of my restaurant. Bibo because it reminds me of my tatay and licious that stands for delicious. I want my restaurant to be the best among others and to be recognized that once they've tasted my foods, they will be energetic (bibo) and will be satisfied with our business.

Also, cooking is either an art, a science, or a perfect blend of both. No matter how you look at it, cooking is, essentially, the practice of transforming something into something else. It saves you money and allows you to create healthy meals that can still taste great. And you can feel satisfied in knowing exactly what’s going into your meals. And for me, learning how to cook is one of the most important skills a person can have.

Moreover, I also decided to put up a business like this because ever since I was a little kid, I always dreamt of being the most incredible cooker you'll be able to meet. And my idol on cooking will always be my family because we all know how to cook uniquely. Especially my brother, all the dishes he was cooking was literally good. And when I started to cook all by myself, I got amazing feedback from them and other people as well. That's why I make this restaurant. I want other people to taste my original versions of every menu that Bibolicious possess.</p>
